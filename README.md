## Project Overview 🚀

The Lovely Pets Project consists of two main components:

1. **Back-End Service**:
   - Provides API endpoints and model inference logic.
   - Built using Python and FastAPI.
   - Integrated with the Comet ML service to load models.

2. **Front-End Service**:
   - A static front-end served using NGINX.
   - Fetches back-end data via a configurable `BACKEND_URL`.

Both services are containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated using **Docker Compose** for development and production environments.

---

## Prerequisites ⚙️

Ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
3. Python 3.10+
4. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (for local development)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the required environment variables:

```dotenv
COMET_API_KEY=your-comet-api-key
COMET_WORKSPACE=your-comet-workspace
COMET_MODEL_NAME=your-model-name
COMET_MODEL_NAME_VERSION=your-model-version
COMET_MODEL_FILE=your-model-file-path
BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:80
```

## How to Use 🛠️

### Build and Run Back-End

1. Build the Back-End Image:

    ```bash
    ./build_image_back.sh
    ```

2. Run the Back-End Container:

    ```bash
    ./run_image_back.sh
    ```

For more details, see docs/backend.md.

### Build and Run Front-End

1.	Build the Front-End Image:

    ```bash
    ./build_image_front.sh
    ```

2.	Run the Front-End Container:

    ```bash
    ./run_image_front.sh
    ```


For more details, see docs/frontend.md.

### Run Full Application Locally

To run the back-end and front-end services together without an external Docker registry, use:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d

- Back-End: `http://localhost:80`
- Front-End: `http://localhost:8080`

For more details, see docs/compose.local.md.

Run Full Application in Production

To run the services using prebuilt images (pushed to Docker registry):

docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d

For more details, see docs/compose.md.
